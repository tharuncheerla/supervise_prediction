# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning. The dataset was collected from **Kaggle**, and various operations such as **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building** were performed. The final model achieved **75% accuracy**.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Description**: The dataset contains features like house size, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes affecting house prices.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Encoded categorical features
- Standardized numerical values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized correlations between features
- Analyzed price distributions
- Identified outliers and handled them accordingly

### 3. Model Building
- Used **Multiple Linear Regression** as the base model
- Tried **Random Forest Regressor** and **Gradient Boosting**
- Achieved **75% accuracy** with the best model

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Used **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score** for evaluation
- Compared different models and selected the best-performing one

## Results
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 75%
